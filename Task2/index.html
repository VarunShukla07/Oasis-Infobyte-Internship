                    <h4>Early Life</h4>
                    <p>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born on 5 February 1985 in the São Pedro parish of Funchal, 
                        the capital of the Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in the nearby parish of Santo António.He has one older brother,
                        Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia "Katia". His mother revealed that she wanted to abort him due to poverty, 
                        his father's alcoholism, and having too many children already, but her doctor refused to perform the procedure, as abortions 
                        were illegal in Portugal at that time.Ronaldo grew up in an impoverished Roman Catholic home, sharing a room with all his siblings.</p>

                    <h4>Goal celebrations</h4>
                    <p>Ronaldo has adopted several goal celebrations throughout his career, including one particular celebration which gained widespread coverage 
                        in the media, when he squatted and stared directly into a camera on the sidelines of the pitch with his hand on his chin. After scoring a 
                        goal, he usually celebrates with a "storming jump" and "turn", before "landing in spread-eagled fashion" into his "signature power stance", 
                        while usually simultaneously exclaiming "Sí" (Spanish and Italian for "yes").This trademark celebration has been dubbed the "Sii" in the media.

                    <h4>2023–present: Arab Club Champions Cup winner</h4>
                    <p>Ronaldo's signing for Al-Nassr resulted in increased popularity both domestically and internationally of the Saudi Pro League, with various European
                        players such as Karim Benzema, Sadio Mané, N'Golo Kanté, Rúben Neves, Riyad Mahrez, Roberto Firmino and Neymar moving to the Saudi Pro League during
                        the summer transfer window, crediting Ronaldo as one of the main factors for moving to the league.</p>
